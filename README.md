# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

## Problem Statement
X Education, an online course provider, struggles with low lead conversion rates, averaging around 30%. This project aims to develop a logistic regression model to identify 'Hot Leads'—prospective customers most likely to convert into paying customers—improving the conversion rate to approximately 80%.

## Business Objectives
- Identify patterns indicating clients likely to convert.
- Ensure creditworthy leads are targeted effectively.
- Enhance risk assessment strategies through data-driven insights.

## Data Description
The dataset contains around 9,000 records of leads with attributes such as:
- Lead Source
- Total Time Spent on Website
- Total Visits
- Last Activity

The target variable is ‘Converted’ (1 for converted, 0 for not converted). 

## Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize trends, correlations, and distributions influencing lead conversion.
3. **Modeling**: Build a logistic regression model to assign lead scores between 0 and 100.
